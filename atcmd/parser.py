class ATParser(object):
    """
    An AT (Hayes command) parser based on a subset of the ITU-T V.250 standard.

    Conformant with the subset of V.250 required for implementation of the
    Bluetooth Headset and Handsfree Profiles, as per Bluetooth SIP
    specifications. Also implements some V.250 features not required by
    Bluetooth - such as chained commands.

    Command handlers are registered with an :py:class:`ATParser` instance.
    These handlers are invoked when command lines are processed by the
    :py:func:`ATParser.process` method.

    The :py:class:`ATParser` object accepts a new command line to parse
    via its :py:func:`process` method. It breaks each command line into one or
    more commands. Each command is parsed for name, type, and (optional)
    arguments, and an appropriate external handler method is called through
    the :py:class:`ATCommandHandler` interface.

    The command types are:

    - **Basic** Command. For example ``"ATDT1234567890"``. Basic command names are
      a single character (e.g. ``"D"``), and everything following this character is
      passed to the handler as a string argument (e.g. ``"T1234567890"``).
    - **Action** Command. For example ``"AT+CIMI"``. The command name is ``"CIMI"``, and
      there are no arguments for action commands.
    - **Read** Command. For example ``"AT+VGM?"``. The command name is ``"VGM"``, and there
      are no arguments for get commands.
    - **Set** Command. For example ``"AT+VGM=14"``. The command name is ``"VGM"``, and
      there is a single integer argument in this case. In the general case
      there can be zero or more arguments (comma delimited) each of integer
      or string type.
    - **Test** Command. For example ``"AT+VGM=?"``. No arguments.

    In V.250 the last four command types are known as Extended Commands, and
    they are used heavily in Bluetooth for example.

    Basic commands cannot be chained in this implementation. For Bluetooth
    headset/handsfree use this is acceptable, because they only use the basic
    commands ATA and ATD, which are not allowed to be chained. For general V.250
    use we would need to improve this class to allow Basic command chaining -
    however it's tricky to get right because there is no delimiter for Basic
    command chaining.

    Extended commands can be chained. For example::

      AT+VGM?;+VGM=14;+CIMI

    This is equivalent to::

      AT+VGM?
      AT+VGM=14
      AT+CIMI

    Except that only one final result code is returned (although several
    intermediate responses may be returned), and as soon as one command in the
    chain fails the rest are abandoned.

    Handlers are registered by there command name via register(Char c, ...) or
    register(String s, ...). Handlers for basic command should be registered by
    the basic command character, and handlers for Extended commands should be
    registered by string.
